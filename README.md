- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Python Magic on data structures and algorithms, turning theory into tangible solutions. From linked lists to web dev wizardry, I love weaving elegant solutions in code.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** React and Next.js, while diving deep into supporting tools like Prisma and Radix UI
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:**  A variety of projects such as front end, back end, full stack, and data domains. 
- 🤔 **I’m looking for help with:** Data analysis and visualization. I'd love to learn more. 
- 📫 **How to reach me:** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumi-nia-means-448b34214/)
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I'm fluent in three languages, can recite the alphabet backwards faster than you can say 'Z to A', and have the superpower of feeling nothing in my thumb (don't worry, it's still handy for coding! 💻). Oh, and puns? They're my jam! 🎵
- 🔍 Dive into my repositories and witness the transformation of ideas into code blocks! Let's build something magical together! ✨
