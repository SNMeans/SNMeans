##  Hey there! I'm Sumi, a former biochemist turned code magician! 🧙‍♂️ 
---
- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Python Magic on data structures and algorithms, turning theory into tangible solutions. 
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** React and Next.js in addition to supporting tools like Prisma and Radix UI.
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:**  A variety of projects such as front end, back end, full stack, and data domains. 
- 🤔 **I’m looking for help with:** Data analysis and visualization. I'd love to learn more. 
- 📫 **How to reach me:** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumi-nia-means-448b34214/)
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I'm fluent in three languages, can recite the alphabet backwards faster than you can say 'Z to A', and have the superpower of feeling nothing in my thumb (don't worry, it's still handy for coding! 💻). Oh, and puns? They're my jam! 🎵
